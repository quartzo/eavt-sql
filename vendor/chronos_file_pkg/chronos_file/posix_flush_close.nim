  ## **Cancellation:** an in-progress `fsync` cannot be aborted, so cancelling
  ## this future does not detach it — cancellation is deferred (`noCancel`)
  ## and the future settles only once the sync finishes. `CancelledError` is

  ##
  ## **Signal backstop:** the worker tries to fire a completion signal so the

  ## `fdatasync`'s guarantees, so only the data-only optimization is lost.
  ## Also note that on macOS `fsync` does not force a physical platter flush
  ## (that needs `fcntl(F_FULLFSYNC)`), matching the rest of the POSIX world.
