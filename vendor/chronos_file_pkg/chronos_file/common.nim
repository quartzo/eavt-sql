    seekable*: bool
      ## True for regular files / block devices: I/O goes through `pread`/`pwrite`
      ## at `offset`, leaving the kernel position untouched. False for
      ## pipe/FIFO/tty, which use sequential `read`/`write` + EAGAIN/`addReader2`.
    pushback*: seq[byte]
      ## Bytes read from the descriptor but logically "un-read" (currently only by
      ## `readLine` after a bare CR on a non-seekable fd). `read` serves these
      ## before issuing a syscall; `readBuffer` (low-level) bypasses them. The
      ## logical file position is `offset - pushback.len`.
    readFut*: Future[int]
      ## In-flight `readBuffer` future while it waits on `addReader2` (pipe/FIFO

    seekFuts*: seq[SeekFut]
      ## In-flight *seekable* seam futures. Populated by every suspending backend
      ## (io_uring and the thread pool); empty only on the synchronous backend,
      ## where the seam completes inline. Tracks every suspended seekable
      ## read/write so `closeWait` can drain them all before closing the fd —
      ## the seekable analog of `readFut`/`writeFut`. Mutated only via
      ## `addTracked`/`removeTracked` (O(1) removal; see `SeekFut`). Concurrent
      ## positioned `*At` ops each get their own entry. Synchronous
      ## `close`/`=destroy` cannot await a drain, so a handle with an op in
      ## flight must be closed with `closeWait` (see `closeImpl`).
    seekOpInFlight*: bool
      ## Single in-flight slot for the *seekable* implicit-offset family
      ## (`read`/`write`/`readLine` and compound forms, which share `offset`):

      ## and positioning ops are turned away via `checkOffsetIdle`. No-op for
      ## non-seekable fds (they use `readFut`/`writeFut`). Load-bearing once the

      ## True when opened with `fmAppend`. Fixed at open; multi-chunk write
      ## loops assume it does not change mid-flight.
      ##
      ## Append-mode writes use a sequential `write` (the kernel appends
      ## atomically) instead of `pwrite` at `offset`: POSIX specifies that
      ## `pwrite` honours its offset even under `O_APPEND`, so on conforming
      ## platforms it would overwrite at a stale offset — only Linux deviates.
      ## Positioned writes (`writeAt`/`writeBufferAt`) are rejected: on Linux
      ## the kernel would silently append instead.
    closed*: bool
      ## Set by `close` so a second `close` is a no-op (avoids closing an fd that
      ## may already have been reused).
    closing*: bool
      ## Set at the start of `closeWait`, before it suspends to cancel and drain
      ## in-flight ops. New operations are rejected from that point on, closing
      ## the window in which another task could slip a fresh read/write onto a
      ## descriptor that is about to be closed (such an op would otherwise fail
      ## with EBADF instead of the graceful contract closeWait promises).
    opened*: bool
      ## Set true only once a real constructor (`openAsync`/`newAsyncFile`) has
      ## taken ownership of a valid fd. The zero value is false, so a
      ## default-constructed `AsyncFile()` is inert: its destructor releases
      ## nothing (it owns no fd — fd 0 would otherwise be stdin) and every public
      ## operation is rejected. Without this, dropping such a handle would close
      ## stdin or abort in the dispatcher (unregistering an fd that was never
      ## registered).
    rbuf*: seq[byte]
      ## Seekable `readLine` read-ahead: bytes pread from the file but not yet
      ## logically consumed; `rbuf[rpos ..< rbuf.len]` are the unconsumed bytes.
      ## Lets successive `readLine`s share one pread instead of re-reading the
      ## post-terminator tail. Only ever populated for seekable fds (non-seekable
      ## `readLine` streams a byte at a time via `pushback`), so `rbuf` and
      ## `pushback` are never both non-empty. The logical read position is
      ## `offset - (rbuf.len - rpos) - pushback.len`. Dropped (with `offset`
