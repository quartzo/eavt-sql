  ## Reads a single line (without the trailing newline). Recognises `\n` and
  ## `\c\L` (and a bare `\c`). Returns `Opt.none(string)` at end of file and
  ## `Opt.some(line)` otherwise — so an empty line (`Opt.some("")`) is
  ## distinguishable from EOF. Precisely: `none` is returned only when the
  ## call consumed no bytes at all; a final line without a trailing
  ## terminator is still `some`.
  ##
  ## `limit` bounds the line length (0 = unlimited): once `limit` bytes have
  ## accumulated and the next byte is not a terminator,
  ## `AsyncFileLimitError` is raised. The over-limit byte is not consumed —
  ## the file position is left exactly `limit` bytes into the line, so the
  ## caller can recover (e.g. skip to the next terminator) deterministically.
  ##
  ## Seekable files (regular files / block devices) read into a persistent
  ## read-ahead buffer (`rbuf`); bytes past the terminator stay buffered for the
  ## next call, so each byte is pread exactly once. As an implicit-offset op it
  ## shares the single in-flight slot with `read`/`write` (a concurrent one
  ## raises `AsyncFileBusyError`). Any later offset-based op
  ## (`read`/`write`/`writeAt`/`setFileSize`) reconciles by dropping the
  ## read-ahead and rewinding the offset, so positions stay consistent. Non-
  ## seekable fds (pipe/FIFO/tty) still read one byte at a time, leaving bytes
  ## beyond the terminator in the descriptor — preserving streaming semantics
  ## and interleaving with the low-level `readBuffer`.
  ##
  ## After a CR, the byte needed to tell CRLF from a bare CR is *peeked without
  ## blocking* on a non-seekable fd: if it has not arrived yet, the CR is taken
  ## as a bare-CR terminator and the completed line is returned immediately,
  ## rather than suspending until more data or EOF (which would hang a finished
  ## line on an idle stream and deadlock line-based request/response protocols).
  ## The trade-off is that a CRLF whose LF is delivered in a separate, delayed
  ## read (CR and LF split across a stall) is read as a bare CR followed by an
  ## empty line — but only in exactly the situations where the old behaviour
  ## would have hung; when the next byte is already buffered (the common case,
  ## e.g. the writer sent `\c\L` together) CRLF is still recognised as one
  ## terminator.
  ##
  ## If a mid-line read fails — or is cancelled — the partial line so far is
  ## lost with the exception and the position stays where reading stopped
  ## (mid-line, not at its start); the handle stays consistent and usable. On a
  ## seekable file the refill is the sole suspension point and rolls its state
  ## back on a failed or cancelled refill (see `refillReadBuf`); on the
  ## synchronous backend it completes inline, so no such cancellation point
  ## exists.
  ##
  ## An *already complete* line is never lost to a post-CR peek *error*: once the
  ## terminator is read, an I/O failure of the peek (the refill needed only to tell
  ## CRLF from a bare CR) still returns the line, deferring the error to the next
  ## call. A *cancellation* of that peek instead propagates as `CancelledError`,
  ## discarding the line like any mid-op cancel, with the position left after the CR.
