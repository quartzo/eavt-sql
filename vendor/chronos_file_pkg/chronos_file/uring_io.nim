## io_uring backend seam (opt-in via `-d:chronosFileUring`; Linux-only).
##
## Every seekable read/write funnels through `readSeekable`/`writeSeekable` (see
## `posix_handle`) and `flush` through `uringFsyncSeam`. When compiled in *and*
## the kernel supports io_uring these shims submit via iori's bridge; otherwise
## the library keeps the synchronous `pread`/`pwrite`/`fsync` path. With the
## define off (the default / every non-Linux target) this module is just the
## `uringCompiled = false` stub and pulls in no dependency on iori.
## `-d:chronosFileNoUring` forces the stub even when `-d:chronosFileUring` is
## also set — the test suite uses this to pin the other backends.
##
## **Buffer ownership under cancellation** — the low-level `*Buffer*` contract.
## The kernel writes into the caller's buffer until the CQE arrives, so a
## cancelled op must *drain* before the buffer is released. `wireDrain` does this:
## the public future carries `OwnCancelSchedule` (chronos won't force-finish it on
## cancel), so our cancel callback issues an ASYNC_CANCEL and holds the future
## pending until the real CQE is reaped, only then settling it `Cancelled`. The
## caller stays blocked in `cancelAndWait` for that window, which keeps its buffer
## alive — zero-copy, no use-after-free. (The high-level owning API needs no
## caller-side rule: its buffer lives in the awaiting frame, kept alive the same way.)
